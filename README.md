Me and saif have Been talking about this for a long time.

We will be officially be making this an open source script which will also be posted on github and on here for completely free.

The src will be posted down here + have its own channel.

We believe we have changed erlc and the way it operates which is why we decided to give y’all the src.

Please use this carefully and don’t use this in ANY illegal way.

Much love from saif, dawg and Doppler.
